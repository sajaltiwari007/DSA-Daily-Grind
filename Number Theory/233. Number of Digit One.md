###  Approach & Intuition (Short Explanation)

The goal is to **count how many times digit `1` appears** in all numbers from `1` to `n`.

## Intuition:
We break the number `n` digit by digit (from least significant to most), and for each digit's position (units, tens, hundreds...), we calculate:

* **How many full cycles of 10, 100, 1000...** include the digit `1` at that position.
* **Handle the case where the current digit is exactly `1`**, and count the extra part (like tail digits).
* **Subtract overcounted cases**, especially when there are `0`s in positions that don’t allow `1` to appear.

This is based on positional place value analysis — for each digit place, we analyze how many times `1` could appear there.

---

###  Example (for intuition):

For `n = 234`, how many times does `1` appear?

* Units place: `1` appears in `...1, 11, 21, ..., 231` → count these.
* Tens place: `1` appears in `10–19, 110–119, 210–219` → count these.
* Hundreds place: `1` appears in numbers like `100–199` → count these.

We repeat this analysis for each digit from right to left.

---

###  Time Complexity:

* **O(log₁₀(n))**: We iterate once per digit in `n`, so at most \~10 iterations for int range.

### Space Complexity:

* **O(1)**: Constant space used for variables only.

## Java Solution
```
class Solution {
    public int countDigitOne(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        if (n <= 9) return 1;

        long count = 0L;
        int multiplier = 1;
        int original = n;
        int divisor = 10;
        int remaining = 1;
        int position = 0;
        boolean isPastFirstDigit = false;

        // Loop to calculate the number of 1s based on digit place
        while (remaining != 0) {
            int higher = original / divisor;
            count += (long) (higher + 1) * multiplier;

            divisor *= 10;
            multiplier *= 10;

            // Adjust count based on the specific condition for '1'
            if (isPastFirstDigit && (n % 10 == 1)) {
                long pow10Next = (long) Math.pow(10, position + 1);
                long pow10Current = (long) Math.pow(10, position);
                long lowerDigits = original % pow10Next;
                count -= (2L * pow10Current - lowerDigits - 1L);
            }

            n /= 10;
            position++;
            isPastFirstDigit = true;
        }

        // Correction pass: subtract extra count if any digit is zero
        int correctionMultiplier = 1;
        while (original != 0) {
            if (original % 10 == 0) {
                count -= correctionMultiplier;
            }
            original /= 10;
            correctionMultiplier *= 10;
        }

        return (int) count;
    }
}
