### Approach

1. **Filter transactions** for the year **2022**.
2. **Group by** `category` and `product`, then **sum** the `spend`.
3. Use a **window function** (`ROW_NUMBER()`) to rank products **within each category** by their total spend.
4. Select only the **top 2** products (rank â‰¤ 2) per category.

###  SQL Query Solution

```sql
WITH product_totals AS (
    SELECT 
        category, 
        product, 
        SUM(spend) AS money
    FROM product_spend
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date) = 2022
    GROUP BY category, product
),
ranked AS (
    SELECT 
        category, 
        product, 
        money,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY money DESC) AS rn
    FROM product_totals
)
SELECT 
    category, 
    product, 
    money AS total_spend
FROM ranked
WHERE rn <= 2
ORDER BY category, total_spend DESC;
